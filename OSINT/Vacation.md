 > People even try to turn their pets into celebrities, it gets annoying quite fast. That reminds me, have you come across @tig3r_and_b3ar ? Apparently their owner is a photographer, I havenâ€™t contacted her though.

Check their instagram account, they are only following 1 person. On that person's account is an email. Email the contact and you will recive an automated response with the flag.

The flag is `CTF{f0und_th3_fl@g}`
