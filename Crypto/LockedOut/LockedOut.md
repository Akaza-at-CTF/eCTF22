> Flag format: CTF{...}

Run the image through an [online QR code scanner](https://4qrcode.com/scan-qr-code.php). Convert the result from base64 to get a URL to access a text file in binary. Convert from binary to decimal and decode using RSA with [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher).

The flag is `CTF{r0n_4D1_130N4rd}`
