# TVA's Trap

> Nadia is caught in a time loop as the guest of honor at a seemingly inescapable party one night in New York City. In order to get out she has to decode the following text message she gets. The TVA being noobs donâ€™t understand that just encoding is not exactly secure. Can you get the flag and help Nadia get to base ?
> 
> Flag format: CTF{...}

The text is formatted to look like `8 x 64`. Perform base64 decoding on it 8 times to get the flag.

The flag is `CTF{w3c-ctf-z0z2_3ry9t0}`
