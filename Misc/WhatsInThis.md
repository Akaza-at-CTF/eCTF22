# What's in this?

> Intelligence has found some wierd material from Mr. Codeshankar(yes, it's him yet again. Sorry, running out of names). Well, Codeshankar isn't giving away the secret so easily this time. [Download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-DVkxxdd9hBNQWptCR4Tr_Ju-k_AwoS/view)

The file is saved as a PNG file but it has a ZIP file signature. Change the file type and then decompress it. Use WinRAR's find tool and search for string in all files matching the flag format.

The flag is `CTF{1t5_all_1n_l4yers}`
